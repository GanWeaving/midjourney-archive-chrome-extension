# Midjourney Archive Chrome Extension

I got a bit tired of Midjourney's limited and buggy archive download solution so I decided to build my own.

## TODO

[ ] Add image settings (prompt, aspect ratio etc) as EXIF data to images before download.
[ ] Improve logo

## Development

After modifying `src/popup.js`, run `npm run build` to update `dist/popup.js`.
